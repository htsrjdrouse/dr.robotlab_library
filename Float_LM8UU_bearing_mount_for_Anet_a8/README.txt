# Summary

Experimental floating LM8UU linear bearing mount using printed leafspring for stabilization.

My stock Anet a8 linear bearing has a grinding problem that leaving a pixie dust on the linear rods that after a few hours of printing, replacing with a printed bushing result in a slip-stick problem which affect print quality. Even the Y axis bearing was aligned smoothly, the pressure from bed level spring cause the Y carriage to bend slightly and cause the bearing to grind/lockup.

So I designed this experimental LM8UU float mount to relieved the rotational force on the linear bearing while still stiff in lateral Z and Y axis force.
    
According to https://www.igus.com/contentData/wpck/pdf/US_en/DryLin%20Linear%20Bearings%202-1%20Rule.pdf float bearing mount should only be required in 1 of 2 rail in Y carriage.

If your anet a8 has a black plastic bearing mount like in the photo you should only need to print 2 of the float mount for Y carriage and 1 for X carriage, fixbearing.stl was provided in case your stock mount was a different height.

My printer was running on this mount for 100+hours and no more pixie dust found.

Tested with PLA on LM8UU bearing.
May need a 4x M4 screw and nut to install.
